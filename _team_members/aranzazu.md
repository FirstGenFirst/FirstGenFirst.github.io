bio: Hi! My name is Aranzazu Soto, and Iâ€™m an undergraduate at Yale University, all while being a first-generation and low-income student. I joined FGF because I want to make sure other students like me continue to have resources and guidance available to them through the college process because it can be very intimidating.
