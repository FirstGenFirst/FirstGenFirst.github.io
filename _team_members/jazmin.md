bio: Hello! My name is Jazmin Reyes and I founded FGF in hopes of supporting first-generation and low-income students like myself through scholarships and sufficient resources. My vision is to lead more students into college by providing helpful insights that I wished someone had told me and tips I have learned through my own experiences in high school and college.
