bio: Hey guys! I'm Alan and I am a current undergraduate at UCLA studying Communications and Film. I joined the FGF team because I also grew up as a first-generation and low-income student from the city of Bell, CA and I want to help reach as many students as possible by using my experience in film and marketing.
