bio: Hi! I'm Caroline Tran and I am an undergraduate at Stanford University from Seattle, WA. As a first-generation college student, I've been diving head first into every new experience, so I know how it feels to be overwhelmed and lost. I joined FGF in hopes of helping other first-gen students navigate the high school to college transition while using my passion for mentorship and art.
