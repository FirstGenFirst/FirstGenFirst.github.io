bio: Hi! <span data-translate-override-es="Soy Christian">I'm Christian</span> and I'm an undergraduate at Stanford studying Computer Science and Biology. I grew up as a first-gen student in Wasco, CA. I joined FGF because I know how hard it is to navigate something as new and scary as college, and I want to help other first-gen students who feel the same way.
