			<p class="editable">FGF would not function if it weren't for our caring donors. That is why Jazmin Reyes, the founder of First Generation First, personally invites you to help this student-run organization grow to its fullest potential. As first-generation and low-income students ourselves, my team and I are doing the best that we can to help other students through scholarships, YouTube videos, and countless online resources but a lot of our work depends heavily on donations from generous people like you! Any amount, big or small, is greatly appreciated by the FGF team and by our scholarship recipients as well. You can help an FGLI student go to college today!</p>
