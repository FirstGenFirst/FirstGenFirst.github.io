			<p class="editable">We know your senior year of high school is filled with college applications, schoolwork, extracurriculars and more, so we decided to put <strong>all potential scholarships in one place</strong> to help you save time on doing the research yourself! We focused on national and local scholarships that also aim to <strong>assist first-generation and/or low-income students</strong> but some may have additional (or fewer) requirements. FGF is neither sponsored by any of these scholarships/organizations nor paid to promote them.</p>
