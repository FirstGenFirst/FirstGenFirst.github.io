		<h3 class="editable">About</h3>
		<p class="editable">The FGF Scholarship aims to financially assist first-generation and/or low-income students who are entering college for the very first time. As FGLI students ourselves, we noticed a ton of random fees and expenses during our physical transition into our first quarter into Stanford and we know other students will face the same, so we want to reward this scholarship to help those who may need it the most! We will be rewarding at least one $500 scholarship but we may pick multiple applicants (depends how much money we raise)!</p>
		<p class="editable">Note: We want to help who may need it most and not necessarily the "best" applicant, so please apply!</p>
