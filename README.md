The site is translated into Spanish and stored in the `es` directory. Use `gulp translate` to generate the translated site files automatically.

The entire site is able to run with or without JavaScript enabled in the browser. Some smaller things, like lazy loading pictures and making a cross-browser sticky header, rely on JavaScript, but are only minor improvements; all the pages should still function essentially in the exact same way whether they have JavaScript enabled or not. (You can do a lot with clever HTML/CSS.)
